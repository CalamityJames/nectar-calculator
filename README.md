# Nectar (and Nectar to Avios) Calculator
Made as I'm too lazy to keep doing maths every time I want to find out how much money I've got in Nectar / Avios / Amex points.

Hopefully this project won't fall foul of [XKCD 1319](https://xkcd.com/1319/).

## Where is it?
Here: https://nectar.calamityjames.dev/

## What does it do?
Calculates how much "real" money you have tied up in Nectar points, and (optionally) Avios and American Express Membership Rewards

## How does it do it?
With maths. Seriously. 1 Avio = 1.6 Nectar points. I basically extrapolated that into a web page that you can fill stuff out on.

## I don't want to tell you how many points I have!!
Frankly, I don't care how many points you have, which is why nothing is sent to my server. Everything is done client-side in JavaScript. Check the source if you don't believe me.

## It would be great if it could do XYZ!
If you think something would be a valuable addition I'm fully open to pull requests, or suggestions in the issues tab.
